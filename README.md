## Zipf's Law

The Zipf's Law is a rule of thumb applicable to numerous geological phenomena. It predicts how many entities of a certain size may be left in a sequence of decreasing
size assuming the largest has been ascertained.

*In general Zipf's Law is a good descripter of natural phenomena. Even if only descriptive, it gives the explorationist some insight in a mineral-resource assessment.*
(Merriam et al. 2004)

Sm/Sn = (n/m)**k

k = 1

Sm the size of item of rank m

Sn the size of item or rank n

k is a proper fraction
